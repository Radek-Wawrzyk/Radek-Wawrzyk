# Welcome to my Github profile!

Hi my name is Radek and I'm the Front-End Developer with a terrible haircut! Despite my hair I love Vue.js stack - literally almost all of my projects are based on Vue - which is cool! However, I am not limited to one technology, I am eager to learn new things.

I strive to make a positive impact on the each product and the client's goals by introducing new solutions and providing a specialized dedicated approach to each project and challenge. I say NO to standard/boring approaches! Feel free to contact me and let's make Front-End great again!
